        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Why should we have something as applied econometrics in the social sciences? That is because we have theories as in Chapters (\\@ref(surplus))--(\\@ref(moral)) and those theories contain variables such as in the direct utility function of equation \\@ref(eq:directutility):\n",
        "\n",
        "\\begin{equation}\n",
        "U(Q,G) = \\frac{A}{\\alpha}\\left( 1- e^{-\\alpha Q} \\right ) + BG.\n",
        "\\end{equation}\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the quantities for the market good $Q$ and the outside good $G$ are considered to be *known*---also often referred to as data. In theoretical work they are fictional or sometimes simulated. A certain amount of consumption of the market good and the outside good lead then some level of utility which economists want to maximise.  \n",
        "\n",
        "This second part of the course is therefore about using data to quantify (socio-economic) parameters. Moreover, we focus on measuring **causal** effects, instead of mere correlations. Note, that in an ideal world, we would like conducting experiments as to measure a causal relation of a phenomenon $X$ on $Y$. However, we almost always only have observational data on, for example demand and prices. Therefore, the second part of this course and syllabus deals with difficulties arising from using observational data to estimate these causal effects and to rewrite models as \\@ref(eq:directutility) such that we can actually *use* data to tease out values for---in this case---$A$ and $\\alpha$.\n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter is organised as follows. The next section addresses the problem of finding a *relation* between some $X$ and some $Y$. Here, we follow an example from the well-known textbook of \\@stock2003introduction where we look at the relation between school class size and school class performance. At the same time, we also introduce some `STATA` commands. To do so, this section deals as well with the statistical framework that is needed for applied econometrics. Note that we assume that the reader already had a course in introductionary statistics and provide only the basic concepts most important for this course in Appendix \\@ref(appreviewstat). \n",
        "\n",
        "## So, what is the problem? {#sec-problem}\n",
        "\n",
        "As explained in the introduction above, applied econometrics aims to give the policy maker well-informed, and evidence based, values for variables she needs. She needs these variables basically for two separate things:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Causal inference**: The policy maker wants to assess the effect of a change in one variable (typically called $X$) on another variables (often called $Y$).\n",
        "2. **Prediction**: If you know what variable $X$ is, what should $Y$ then be?\n",
        "\n",
        "Nowadays, most applied econometric techniques are concerned with causal inference, not so much with prediction. Even more, the techniques often applied are beneficial for correct causal inference, but might harm prediction. However, see that without correct causal inference (so knowing the **true** causal effect) prediction is always cumbersome. That is why current methods such as machine learning methods first focus on finding the correct causal mechanism (even without sometimes specifying what they may be) and then optimize prediction. \n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, finding (causal) mechanism helps the scientist or policy maker in assessing the outcomes of a particular (policy) intervention. In the economic realm one could think about trying to assess the following quantities:\n",
        "\n",
        "- To what extent do people eat less meat if we increase the prices with 1% (using a meat-tax)?\n",
        "- If we increase Dutch dikes with one meter, how much less flood risk will there be?\n",
        "- How much do classes perform better is we reduce class-sizes with one student?\n",
        "\n",
        "### A first encounter with `STATA`\n",
        "\n",
        "For this section, we will focus on the last question. And this is an important question for policy as teachers are costly, but parents value school performance very highly. To start answering this question we *use* data. In `STATA` data is in a specific format, named `.dta`. Note that this format is not in a text format and cannot be read with the human eye. To start using `STATA` we first need to set the working directory to the appropriate directory^[I suggest that for this---and every other course---you have a specific directory]. You can do this by using the dropdown menu `File` in `STATA` and click on `Change working directly` but you can also do this with the following command:\n",

Another way of looking at this is displayed in Figure \\@ref(fig:ass1).
